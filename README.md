**Yet another network manager for GNU/Linux**

### About
Loom is a network manager easy to use via it's
[DBus](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/).

### Motivation
Inspired by the [Cockpit Project](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/)
and the wish to have a web tool to configure some typical network settings on a
Raspberry Pi this project was started.
More or less this a playground to learn and work with the
[GLib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable) general-purpose utility
library, especially with the included object system
[GObject](https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/index.html), and the
[GNU Autotools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system).

### Caveats
This software is under heavy development.
